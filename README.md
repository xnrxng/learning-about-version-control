# Learning about Version Control
Author: Rui Xiang Yu
Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!
What I like the most about version control: how it is easy to go back to previous versions of the file in case you mess up the current code, or you need to bring something back from the past.
What I find most challenging about version control: although I understand why these processes are needed, the whole process of add, commit, push, pull, feels repetitive especially when solving merge conflicts and it is easy to accidentally mix things out of order.
